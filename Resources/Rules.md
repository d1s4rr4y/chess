# Rules

## Castling

- Kingside (short castling) consists of moving the king to g1 and the rook to f1 for white, and the king to g8/the rook to f8 for black
- Queenside (long castling) consists of moving the king to c1/rook to d1 for white, and the king to c8/the rook to d8 for black

### Conditions

- Neither the king nor the rook have previously moved
- There are no pieces between the king and the rook
- The king is not currently in check
- The king does not pass through or finish on a square that is attacked by an enemy piece.

## En Passant

When a pawn advances 2 squares on its initial move and ends the turn adjacent to an enemy pawn on the same rank, it may be captured en passant by the enemy pawn as it it had only moved one square. This capture is only legal on the move immediately following the pawn's advance.

## Promotion

If a player advances a pawn to its eigth rank, the pawn is then promotied to a queen, rook, bishop or knight of the same colour at the choice of the player.

## Check

A king is in check when it is under attack by at least one enemy piece. A piece unable to move because it would place it's own king in check may still deliver check to the opposing player. 

It is illegal to make a move that places or leaves one's own king in check. The ways to get out of check are:

- Move the king to a space where it is not in check
- Capture the checking piece
- Interpose a piece between the king and the opponent's threatening piece.

## End of Game

## Checkmate

If a player's king is placed in check and there is no legal move that player can make to escape check, the king is said to be checkmated, the game ends, and that player loses. Unlike other pieces, the king is never captured. 

### Resigning

Either player may resign at any time, conceding the game to the opponent.

## Draws

- No possible moves but the king is not in check (stalemate)
- Both players repeat the same 3 moves in a row
- Both kings are along on the board (or with insufficient material to win)
- If there has been no pawn move and no capture in the last 50 turns, the game is a draw.
